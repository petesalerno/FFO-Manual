            [1] =&gt; The policy should outline your commitment to food safety; how it is implemented and communicated to employees and list corrective actions for personnel who violate your food safety policies and procedures.
            [2] =&gt; Please enter any additional information in the box if required. Any information entered will appear in your printed manual.
            [3] =&gt; Having a food safety policy helps remind you, your family, employees, customers, and auditors, of why you are doing what you do. This statement should address your company's commitment to food safety, food quality, food sanitation and worker hygiene.

Here’s an example: "Management and employees at [insert your farm name here] are committed to producing and marketing a safe product through good agricultural and handling practices that focus on food safety and quality."
            [5] =&gt; For example, "Here at [insert your farm name here], employees are trained at hire and have training on an ongoing basis in all aspects of our food safety requirements as outlined in our Food Safety Plan manual."

            [9] =&gt; 
            [10] =&gt; Please enter 24-hour contact information for individuals who should be contacted in the case of a food safety emergency. Please also enter the contact information of individuals who act in this role during their absence.

            [12] =&gt; Someone needs to be accountable for overseeing your food safety protocols and procedures to ensure effective implementation and compliance. This non-compliance will be reflected in your food safety plan which may negatively impact your ability to gain entry to wholesale and retail markets and/or gain certification in Good Agricultural Practices.

            [11] =&gt; 
            [13] =&gt; Keeping written records of your food safety activities is very important. Even if you follow proper food safety practices, unless they are documented, there is no way to prove that they were followed. This non-compliance will be reflected in your food safety plan which may negatively impact your ability to gain entry to wholesale and retail markets and/or gain certification in Good Agricultural Practices.
            [14] =&gt; Systems and records need to be in place to enable traceability of product delivered to recipients (one step forward) and records that link product with source of the produce (one step backward) e.g., soil amendments, seeds/transplants, agricultural chemicals.

Note: One step forward traceability is not required for direct to consumer sales. 
            [15] =&gt; Keeping written records of your food safety activities is very important.

            [16] =&gt; Please attach your traceback policy to the appendix.
            [17] =&gt; 
            [18] =&gt; Please attach your recall policy to the appendix of this section. Your policy should include the names and roles of people in your recall team and include the names of people who will act as their back up in times of absence.
            [20] =&gt; An effective recall program includes, as a minimum, the following elements2:

Name(s) and contact information of the recall coordinator(s) and recall team.
Written step-by-step procedures to be followed during a recall.
            [21] =&gt; Have assigned employees been trained in the following and are aware that in the event of contaminated product being released to the marketplace they need to:

            [27] =&gt; 
            [28] =&gt; 
            [30] =&gt; Corrective action is required whenever an observation or audit indicates a non-conformance with food safety requirements. Non-conformance may result from deviations to normal operation – such deviations can be minor, such as those which are not a major food safety concern (e.g., spilled product on the floor) and which can be rectified immediately by the employee. Deviations can also be major such as those deviations which could lead to a major food safety concern. For major deviations, employees must advise the producer, storage intermediary, and/or packer immediately of the problem.
            [31] =&gt; Please attach your corrective action procedure to the appendix for this section of the manual. Your procedure should include the name of the person(s) whom deviations should be reported to and the names of the person(s) who have responsibility for ensuring actions are completed.

            [56] =&gt; 
            [55] =&gt;  Field sanitation units/portable toilets should be designed, constructed, and located to minimize the risk for product contamination. It is important to perform servicing away from areas where food, food contact surfaces or produce fields are located as spills and leaks may occur. This non-compliance will be reflected in your food safety plan which may negatively impact your ability to gain entry to wholesale and retail markets and/or gain certification in Good Agricultural Practices.
            [57] =&gt; It is recommended that farm sewage treatment or septic systems be evaluated annually at a minimum. Systems need to comply with local laws and regulations.
            [58] =&gt; 
            [59] =&gt; It is important to ensure that sewage and septic systems are maintained so they do not leak/pose contamination risks to food products and fields. This non-compliance will be reflected in your food safety plan which may negatively impact your ability to gain entry to wholesale and retail markets and/or gain certification in Good Agricultural Practices.
            [60] =&gt; There needs to be a policy in place to ensure that leakages and spills are managed and disposed of appropriately and any corrective actions documented
            [61] =&gt;  Any information entered will appear in your printed manual.
            [63] =&gt; Any sewage spills must be dealt with immediately in a manner to minimize the risk of contaminating produce. In the case of a field/portable toilet spilling or any other septic leakage occurring in or near fields, cleanup steps will need to be performed immediately. By answering the following questions a written policy will appear in your food safety manual.

            [80] =&gt; 
            [81] =&gt; Best practice information recommends that bracelets, large chains and necklaces not be allowed in the packinghouse or in the field for safety and hygiene reasons. Items that may be allowed, depending on your requirements, are:

Watches, wedding rings or other fairly simple rings;
Necklaces that stay covered by clothing;
Unobtrusive earrings that stay near the head and pose no risk to falling out;
Other concealed or covered jewelry.
            [82] =&gt; It is recommended that cell phones be kept secure. Cell phones or other items should not be kept in pockets if there is risk of them falling out.
